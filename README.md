# RoToJa-WebRTC
Basically a small conference tool for audio and video conferencing with webRTC technology

This was one of my first projects and its design is pretty ungly.
It uses the webRTC technology to create conferencing rooms for several people.
In this stage it works already fine but it is far away from being useable in productive mode
